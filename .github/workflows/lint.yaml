  # this job provides the single required status for PRs to be merged into main.
  # instead of updating the protected branch status in github, developers can update the needs section below
  # to require additional status checks to protect main.
  # the job uses the alls-green action to get around the github issue that treats a "skipped" required status check
  # as passed. github will skip a job if an upstream needed job fails, which would defeat the purpose of this required
  # status check.
